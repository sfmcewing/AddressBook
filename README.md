#### By _**Sarah McEwing**_

## Description

_This creates an address book where you can store contact information for people you know. The first page displays any existing contacts, and provides the user with form to fill create a new contact. After the form is submitted, the user is taken to a page which tells them they created a contact, and displays the information as well as a link to view all of their saved contacts. The home page also displays a delete button, which deletes all contacts and takes the user to a confirmation page. _
